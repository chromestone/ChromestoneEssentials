# Chromestone Essentials

  - A Minecraft minigame (that doesn't ever end lol)

This plugin puts together a minigame through assembling and interfacing with other plugins I found.

**Some features include:**

* Random zombie pigman spawning (you can farm the gold nuggets and use them to exchange as money if another shop plugin is installed)

* Lighting Casting (for Goddesses)

* A "shop" location / spawn protection (no PVP in a given area)

**DEPENDENCIES:**

* CombatTag

_RECOMMENDED to be used with (as how I used it):_

* Carz (this allowed easy transportation in a minecart, tons of fun :)

* Chest Refilling plugins (gives some "Hunger Games" theme into the game)

* Shop plugins

Bukkit version: bukkit-1.7.2-R0.3
